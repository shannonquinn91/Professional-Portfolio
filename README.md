# Professional-Portfolio

11/13/2020:
After spending the last 8 weeks in the Coding Bootcamp, I have created a professional portfolio to showcase what I have learned and accomplished so far. I hope that this will help me when I start searching for jobs. As I continue to learn more and develop more skills, I will make updates to this porfolio to share with potential employers.
